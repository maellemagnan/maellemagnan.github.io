  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Maëlle Magnan</strong>, an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto pursuing a degree in Astronomy and Physics with a minor in Mathematics. I currently serve as the Vice President of Communications for the Astronomy Union and act as an advisor for U of T’s Collective Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE).</p>

  <p>My academic interests lie in both small-scale structures, such as stars and galaxies, and their formation and evolutionary processes, as well as in large-scale systems including black holes and the plasma dynamics in their surrounding environments.</p>

  <p>Outside of academics, I enjoy hiking, cooking, and playing roller derby. I’ve played competitive roller derby since 2017!</p>
