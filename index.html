    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Maëlle Magnan</strong>, an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto pursuing a degree in Astronomy and Physics with a minor in Mathematics. Growing up in Regina, Saskatchewan, I was lucky to have clear views of the night sky which sparked my passion for the stars. I believe everyone should have this experience which is why I am currently working on a side project quantifying sattelite pollution in astronomical images over the past 10 years.  </p> 
      
    <p>I currently serve as the Vice President of Communications for the Astronomy Union and act as an advisor for U of T’s Collective Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE). I am also a part of the French and Francophone Association as the Director of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.</p>

    <p>My research interests lie in both small-scale structures, such as stars and galaxies, and their formation and evolutionary processes, as well as in large-scale systems including black holes and the plasma dynamics in their surrounding environments.</p>

    <p>Outside of academics, I enjoy hiking, cooking, and playing roller derby. I’ve played competitive roller derby since 2017!</p>
