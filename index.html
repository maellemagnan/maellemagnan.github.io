    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Maëlle Magnan</strong>, an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto pursuing a degree in Astronomy and Physics with a minor in Mathematics. Growing up in Regina, Saskatchewan, I was lucky to have clear views of the night sky which sparked my passion for the stars. I believe everyone should have this experience which is why I am currently working on a side project quantifying sattelite pollution in astronomical images over the past 10 years.  </p> 
      
    <p>I currently serve as the Vice President of Communications for the Astronomy Union and act as an advisor for U of T’s Collective Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE). I am also a part of the French and Francophone Association as the Director of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.</p>

    <p>My research interests lie in both small-scale structures, such as stars and galaxies, and their formation and evolutionary processes, as well as in large-scale systems including black holes and the plasma dynamics in their surrounding environments.</p>

    <p>Outside of academics, I enjoy hiking, cooking, and playing roller derby. I’ve played competitive roller derby since 2017!</p>

      <h2>Exploring Gas Kinematics in Barred Galaxies</h2>
    
      <div class="research-content">
        <div class="research-text">
          <p><strong>University of Toronto / Supervisor:</strong> Dr. Tobias Géron and Prof. Maria Drout</p>
          <p><strong>Date:</strong> May 2025 – Present</p>
          <p>Stellar bars are elongated features in disk galaxies that torque and funnel gas inward, which can either trigger starbursts or dynamically heat gas—both pathways that can lead to quenching. While strong bars are known to induce rapid inflow, the role of weaker bars remains unclear. I am analyzing spectroscopic observations of 18 galaxies (7 strongly barred, 7 weakly barred, 4 unbarred controls) drawn from Galaxy Zoo DESI (0.01 &lt; z &lt; 0.05, M<sub>r</sub> &lt; −18.96), using the Isaac Newton Telescope’s IDS spectrograph with parallel and perpendicular slit alignments. Gaussian fit analysis of Hα emission measures spatial profiles of flux amplitude, line width, and central wavelength. Preliminary results reveal pronounced Hα amplitude peaks at bar ends in strong bars, indicating bar-driven inflow as shown in previous studies (Géron et al., 2024). Similar features were not observed in weakly barred galaxies, indicating that these bars may not cause inflow on the same scale. Ongoing work will convert the fit parameters to physical inflow rates, velocity dispersion, and equivalent widths to assess the efficiency of gas funnelling across bar strengths and their impact on galaxy evolution.</p>
